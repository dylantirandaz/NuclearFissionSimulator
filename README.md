## Mathematical Explanation of Nuclear Fission Simulation

This document provides a mathematical explanation of the nuclear fission simulation using Monte Carlo methods.

### Watt Spectrum

The Watt spectrum describes the distribution of neutron energies emitted during fission:

$$ f(E) = a \sinh\left(\sqrt{bE}\right) e^{-aE - bE} $$

### Cross-section Interpolation

The cross-section data for each isotope is interpolated using cubic splines:

$$ Ïƒ(E) = interp1d(energy\_data, cross\_section\_data, kind='cubic') $$

### Neutron Scattering

Neutrons scatter isotropically according to Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:

$$ f(v) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \left(\frac{v^3}{kT}\right)^{3/2} e^{-\frac{v^2}{2kT}} $$

### Simulation Process

The Monte Carlo simulation progresses through several steps:

1. Initialization of neutrons and materials.
2. Transport simulation using random walk.
3. Interaction determination (fission, absorption, or scattering).
4. Temperature evolution and energy deposition calculations.
5. Criticality analysis based on neutron flux and reaction rates.
